# Hindustani-Classical-Raga-Identification

This project focuses on the classification of hindustani classical ragas using Machine Learning techniques. The Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) will be extracted from various audio recordings, which will then be used to train and evaluate CNN to accurately identify and distinguish between different ragas. MFCCs are highly effective in representing the timbral and spectral characteristics of sound. The goal is to develop a robust system for raga recognition, which has potential applications in music information retrieval, music education, and cultural preservation.

In the initial phase we are taregting on the below Ragas to develop our CNN model.
- Asavari
- Bageshree
- Bhairava
- Bhairavi
- Bhoopali
- Darbari
- Malkauns
- Sarang
- Yaman

  In the later phase, we want to develop another model using the spectrogram features to make a performance comparison between two approaches.
